# Spanner Database

## **Overview:**
The spanner population subsystem fills the database with random sample data that simulates various components in the real system.

 In order to simulate entities that are enqueued in the system, there exists tables for:<br/>
 * Videos<br/>
 * Queues <br/>
* Enqueue Rule<br/>

This data is populated in a way that ensures maximum randomness within constraints. Each video entry has a random list of features, and each enqueue rule entry has a random list of features(rules) for a queue id, that will simulate determining what queue videos with those features will be enqueued to. 

 In addition, to simulate the review queue state (entity getting enqueued, routed or verdict is made), there exists tables for:<br/>
 * Enqueue Signal<br/>
 * Routed Signal<br/>
 * Verdict Signal <br/>

This data is populated in a way that ensures maximum randomness, while simulating realistic life cycles of entities. In order for life cycles to be realistic, EnqueueSignal timestamps must be earlier than corresponding RoutedSignal entries if they were routed, and VerdictSignal entries if they were not routed. If it was routed and a verdict was reached, the timestamp for the RoutedSignal must be earlier than the VerdictSignal. Queue Id fields for these cases must also reflect correct movement from queue to queue. In the real system, an entity could be routed multiple times, however, for simplicity, we will be assuming entities can only be routed once at most.

## Functionality:<br/>
Running this program will clear all entries previously existing in all tables, and then fill all tables with them sample data described above.<br/><br/>
